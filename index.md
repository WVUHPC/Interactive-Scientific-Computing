This lesson will show you tools to start using our HPC cluster right away for Interactive Scientific Computing.
We will use Open On Demand to create jobs that trigger Jupyter or RStudio sessions. 
From there we will use those sessions to offer a brief introduction to three important languages in Scientific Computing: Python, Julia and R.
Finally we introduce Globus On Line, a tool to transfer data between your local machine and the cluster from a web interface.
