All that you need to follow this lesson is a browser, Firefox and Chrome are good examples. Safari has issues with Open on Demand so MacOS users should try to install one of the other alternatives.

The second thing you need is network access to campus resources. If you are following this lesson from home, you will need a VPN.
Instructions to access WVU's VPN can be found here:

Once you can establish secure connexion to in-campus resources access the web portal for Open On Demand at WVU:
